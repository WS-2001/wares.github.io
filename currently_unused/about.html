                <p class="body">Hey there, my name is Wares! First of all, I'm really happy you're here and I hope you've had and continue to have a good day. 
                                I'm someone who has been interested in tech since a very young age. Ever since my childhood, I've always wondered how things
                                    were built and programmed. From hardware like the PS2 to software like games (you can also see that my love for technology started from gaming!).
                                As I grew up, my curiosity continued to develop more and more, and as smartphones were getting more popular so has my interest in software. Software - while still big 
                                back then - was not the behemoth it is today.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="body">This exploration and developing curiosity continued into my teenage years, and once I had access to my first computer things progressed even faster! Personal projects,
                    experimentation, and creation was practically all that happened when I was on my computer. To summarise, I started with modding in games like Minecraft, which evolved into me learning video editing through software like Vegas Pro and Premiere Pro. 
                    That then led into me learning VFX and animation in Cinema4D, Maya and After Effects. Following that, I wanted to create actual software and started by creating interactive wallpapers through coding with the app Wallpaper Engine on Steam. This was when I knew 
                    that technology was what I was invested in and I wanted to keep exploring it.</p>
