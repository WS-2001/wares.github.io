                <p class="body"><b>iOS app to manage financial transactions between friends and family, fully leveraging Apple's design language and simplicity.</b></p>

                <p class="body">Personally, calculating how much you owe people and vice-versa took a lot of effort and was both tiresome and boring - especially during public outings where you just want to quickly track the 'transaction' and go back to socialising. My aim with this app was to fix that, and to achieve that I set myself many personal goals. The main ones that stood out to me were the following:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Using research on similar apps on the market, have the right balance between complexity and simplicity to ensure it's quick, but also allow for a power user to use it effectively with advanced options.</li>
                    <li>The app had to be quick to open and navigate to ensure any actions the user wanted to execute happened as fast as possible. To do this, I calculated time-to-first-transaction and time-to-open times for several similar apps already on the market.</li>
                    <li>Feeling like a native Apple app was a must for simplicity. This would allow anyone to use the app effectively as it would be something they are already familiar with.</li>
                    <li>Allow for advanced analytics and insights with a predictive algorithm and historical data views.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="body">Simplicity, speed, power. Based on my research, it was clear that I had to implement these three elements in an efficient and effective way to deem it a success.</p>

                <h1>The App</h1>
                <h3>Design Language</h3>
                <p>In line with Apple's design language, there are two tabs at the bottom of the screen and all have that distinct, familiar Apple look. SwiftUI was specifically chosen for the familiar Apple aesthethic, and straightforward implementation process of all elements. Everything animates and interacts the same way as it would in a native Apple app.</p>
                <h3>Error Handling</h3>
                <p>Naturally, I've tried my best in making sure errors were always caught and handled. There is always input validation on user input, and the app will not crash when an error occurs. Instead, the user will be met with an alert and the issue will be highlighted.</p>
