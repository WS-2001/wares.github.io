# Portfolio Website
## Wares Sadat

Hello there! This is the repository for my [portfolio website](https://wares.pages.dev).

I created the website from scratch purely by myself with minimal use of external tools like gen-AI (more on that below). My aim was to reinforce what I learned through my projects and university, continue learning as that's a vital skill to have in Computer Science, and see what I succeeded at and struggled at.

I use Cloudflare Pages to host the website as it was easy to set up, free for non-commercial use, and allows me to have a simple, free URL that works with the website's content (wares.pages.dev).

### The Big Question: Did I use generative AI to create the website?

Largely no - hopefully that is also reflected in the website and its code. I say largely because I did use it here and there to help me fix some bugs that I was unable to fix myself. I have some strong feelings about using gen-AI as a developer, which I'll outline below.

I consider it to be similar to google in that you *should* use it in this day and age, as it would be inefficient to not utilise all tools at your disposal. While it is a very impressive tool that is beneficial to everyone, I vehemently believe that you should **only** use these tools if you are able to understand the code, learn from it, and you try to develop what you're making by yourself with little assistance first and foremost. It is vital to me that these tools are used to reinforce your learning and development, and not to replace you as an individual. You won't learn anything that way.

*It should be used as a tool to **help** you understand and learn, not to **replace** your development.*

All that said, gen-AI makes developing and coding much more friendly to newcomers, and hopefully a lot more people decide to join the community, making sure it's well-written, maintainable code! :)
